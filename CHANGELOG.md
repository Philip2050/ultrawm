# Changelog

All notable changes to UltraWM will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-28 — Multi-Monitor Workspaces

### Added
- **Multi-monitor workspaces**: Each monitor now has its own independent set of 4 workspaces
- `MonitorWorkspaces` struct: per-monitor monitor info + grids + current workspace index
- `window_monitors` HashMap: tracks which monitor each window belongs to
- `monitor_for_hwnd()`: determines monitor from window position
- Per-monitor tiling: `tile_all_windows()` now iterates monitors and tiles only their windows

### Changed
- `grids: Vec<GridState>` → `monitor_workspaces: Vec<MonitorWorkspaces>`
- `switch_workspace()` now switches on the monitor containing the focused window
- Bar shows workspace indicators for the active monitor
- `manage_window()` assigns windows to correct monitor and workspace

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-28 — Feature Wiring & Polish

### Added
- Theme picker UI wired up (`Win+G`): opens listbox, Enter applies theme
- Fullscreen toggle (`Win+F`): uses SetWindowPos with HWND_TOPMOST
- `Win+Shift+Arrows`: move focused window to adjacent cell with collision swapping
- `GridState::move_window()`: moves window to new cell, swaps if occupied
- Focus-follows-mouse (`focus_follows_mouse: bool` in config): polls cursor position
- Startup rules extended: `WindowRule` now supports `workspace` field
- Window close cleanup: `remove_window()` now also removes from `window_workspaces` and `anim`
- `ThemeManager::apply_idx()`: apply theme by index for picker

### Fixed
- Win+1/2/3/4 workspace switching keyboard shortcuts
- Bar updates active workspace indicator when switching
- Bar initialization sets initial workspace state
- All remaining `self.grid` references updated to `current_grid()` pattern
